# WeatherForecastBot

pet-project

It's a Telegram bot with simple parser from www.gismeteo.ru. It has his own database based on PostgreSQL which includes information about bot's users and all Russian cities and towns from gismeteo site. The main file is 'test_bot.py'.

Nowadays I have problem with hosting, so bot can work only when I turn on the program on my pc.

If something changes I will update this information :)
